    MonomialAlgebras
  Headline
    Decompose a monomial algebra as a module over a subalgebra.
  Description
    Text
      {\bf Overview:}
      
      Consider a semigroup A in \mathbb{N}^m and a subsemigroup B \subset A.
      such that K[A] is finite over K[B].
      
      The corresponding monomial algebra K[A] is decomposed as a direct sum of ideals in K[B]. In
      
      Le Tuan Hoa, Juergen Stueckrad: Castelnuovo–Mumford regularity of simplicial toric rings.
      
      it is shown that this decomposition exists in the case that K[B] is isomorphic to a polynomial ring
      and is the Noether normalization of K[A] (the simplicial case). It is easy to see that the same is true
      in the general case.
      
      {\bf Setup:}

      This package requires Macaulay2 version 1.4 or newer.

      Install this @TO Package@ by doing

    (decomposeMonomialCurve,List)
  Headline
    Decomposition for the monomial curve.
  Usage
    decomposeMonomialCurve(A)
  Inputs
    A:List
        of integers containing (dehomogenized) generators of A
  Outputs
    :HashTable
  Description
   Text
     This is a convenient special case of the general function @TO decomposeMonomialAlgebra@.  

     The list A is expected to contain dehomogenized generators of a semigroup.
     This function transforms A into a homogeneous semigroup containing
     powers of the variables. The corresponding monomial algebra
     is decomposed as a direct sum of ideals in its Noether normalization.

     For example the homogeneous coordinate ring of the smooth rational quartic decomposes
     as follows:

   Example
     A = {1,3,4};
     decomposeMonomialCurve A

     Some more smooth space curves:

   Example
     for d from 4 to 10 do (A = {1,d-1,d};print(A,decomposeMonomialCurve A));

    Decomposition of one monomial algebra over a subalgebra
  Usage
    decomposeMonomialAlgebra f
  Inputs
    f : RingMap
        between multihomogenous polynomial rings
  Outputs
    :HashTable
       Let A be the degree monoid of the @TO target@ of f and analogously B for the @TO source@.
       The @TO keys@ are representatives of congruence classes in ZZ*A / ZZ*B.
       The value associated to a key k is a tuple whose first component is an ideal of
       K[B] isomorphic to the K[B]-submodule of K[A] consisting of elements in the class k,
       and whose second component is an element of ZZ*A that is the translation
       vector between the weights of the ideal and the weights of the submodule of

  Description

     Let K[A] be the monomial algebra of the degree monoid of the @TO target@ of f and 
     let analogously K[B] for @TO source@ of f. Assume that K[A] is finite as a K[B]-module.
     
     The monomial algebra K[A] is decomposed as a direct sum of ideals in K[B].
     
   Example
      A = {{4,2},{10,6},{3,7},{3,6}}
      B = {{4,2},{10,6},{3,7}}
      S = ZZ/101[x_0..x_(#A-1), Degrees=>A];
